## 📊 Test Organization Standards

### **Test Separation Requirement**
All crates must follow standardized test organization:
- **No embedded tests** in `src/lib.rs` files
- **Separate test files** in `tests/` directory 
- **Group by functionality** - organize tests by intent/category, not one test per file
- **Clear naming** - test file names should indicate the functionality being tested
- **Public API only** - tests should only use public APIs, no private struct/method access
