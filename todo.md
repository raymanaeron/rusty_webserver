## 📋 Development Log & Session Context

### ✅ **Phase 1.1 Complete (Current Session)**
**What was done:**
- Successfully split monolithic `main.rs` into 5 focused library crates
- Created clean workspace structure with shared dependencies
- Preserved 100% of existing functionality (static file serving with SPA fallback)
- All build scripts (`b_mac.sh`, `b_linux.sh`, `b_win.bat`) work unchanged
- All clean scripts (`c_mac.sh`, `c_linux.sh`, `c_win.bat`) work unchanged
- Comprehensive testing verified debug and release builds compile and run correctly
- Created detailed 6-phase roadmap with business model and technical architecture

**Current file structure:**
```

- Enhanced error handling with descriptive messages for configuration issues

**Configuration features implemented:**
- TOML file parsing with proper error handling
- Static file configuration validation (directory existence, fallback file)
- Proxy route configuration validation (URL format, timeout values) - ready for Phase 2
