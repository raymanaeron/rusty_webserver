## 📊 Test Organization Standards

### **Test Separation Requirement**
All crates must follow standardized test organization:
- **No embedded tests** in `src/lib.rs` files
- **Separate test files** in `tests/` directory 
- **Group by functionality** - organize tests by intent/category, not one test per file
- **Clear naming** - test file names should indicate the functionality being tested
- **Public API only** - tests should only use public APIs, no private struct/method access

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Configuration
```toml

[static]
directory = "./public"
fallback = "index.html"

# Simple proxy
[[proxy]]
path = "/api/*"
target = "http://localhost:3000"
timeout = 30
```

### Load Balanced Configuration
```toml
[[proxy]]
path = "/api/*"
strategy = "round_robin"
targets = [
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://localhost:3001",
    "http://localhost:3002"
]
health_check = "/health"
health_interval = 30
```

### HTTPS Configuration
```toml
[ssl]
enabled = true
cert_file = "./certs/server.crt"
key_file = "./certs/server.key"
redirect_http = true

[[proxy]]
path = "/api/*"
targets = ["http://localhost:3000"]  # Backend stays HTTP
ssl_required = true  # Only serve over HTTPS
```

### WebSocket Configuration
```toml
[[proxy]]
path = "/ws/*"
targets = ["http://localhost:3001"]
protocol = "websocket"
sticky_sessions = true  # Keep connections to same backend
health_check = "/ws/ping"
```

### Tunnel Configuration
```toml
[tunnel]
enabled = true
server = "tunnel.httpserver.io"
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
subdomain = "myproject"  # Results in https://myproject.httpserver.io
custom_domain = "api.mycompany.com"  # Optional custom domain

# Expose specific local services publicly
[[tunnel.expose]]
local_path = "/api/*"
public_path = "/api/*"
local_target = "http://localhost:3000"

[[tunnel.expose]]
local_path = "/admin/*"
public_path = "/admin/*"
local_target = "http://localhost:8000"
```

### Complete Integration Example
```toml
# Local static files
[static]
directory = "./public"

# Local proxy routes
[[proxy]]
path = "/api/*"
targets = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001"]
strategy = "round_robin"

# Public tunnel
[tunnel]
enabled = true
